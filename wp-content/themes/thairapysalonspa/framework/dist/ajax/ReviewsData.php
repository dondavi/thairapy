I was able to use my 10% off appt coupon that I had, however, I am not sure why the receptionist marked up my appt 10% ($45 to $50) then marked down with the 10% ($50 to $45)? Which then ended up coming out to to be the exact same price, even though, $5 is not a big deal.|1|1389124508

Second, the front staff is always helpful and friendly! I see Rondeann for my haircut/color and she is amazing! But I have also seen a few of the other stylists and they were great as well. Friendly, knowledgable, and they listen to what you want for your hair without being pushy. They are also not pushy about products. I have also seen both of the waxers and they are incredible--kind and gentle. I recommend this place for sure.|1|1389284878

She took the time to listen to what I wanted & offered suggestions where needed. She did a fantastic job, and I\'ve already received a ton of compliments! After having the same stylist for nearly 6 years in a different state, I am very relieved to have found a salon & a stylist with whom I plan to continue to visit for a long time. I will certainly recommend Thairapy & Rondeann to everyone who asks! Thanks so much!|1|1389291146

Thairapy was able to accommodate both to begin our services at the same time, although we had to alternate since they only had one nail tech and one massage therapist that morning. The spa area is small but the massage room and pedi chair are very welcoming. I also enjoyed a quick steam bath after my massage! Celeste was very nice and took her time. Although I can\'t quite remember the massage therapist\'s name, I do remember she was did a great job at getting all of my stress/sore spots. She spent extra time on my shoulders and lower back which I desperately needed. I would definitely recommend the spa services at Thairapy. The small space is quiet and welcoming.|1|1389291272

2|||Anonymous |Stylist is very knowledgeable & cuts hair very well, BUT she does not listen to you. I gave her feedback in the initial consultation, she washed my hair & then she just started cutting away before a consensus was made. Then, when I stopped her, she basically would not listen to me and did what she thought would look good, again, without incorporating my feedback. Then, when I compied (because she had basically already started cutting and had to finish), she insistently pushed her agenda, basically telling me that I was wrong; even insisting how I would react or feel about one cut over the other. I.e. The stylist was a know-it-all who didn\'t listen. She\'s also kind of a one-up\'er. No matter what I\'ve done or gone through, she\'s always gone above and beyond. Annoying! Again...good technical skills. Terrible customer relations.|1|1389292740

5|||Anonymous |I absolutely loved this place! I have never enjoyed getting a haircut, shampoo, and styling so much! My stylist was (and forever will be) Margaret and she made me feel so comfortable, being that it was my first time there. She also made me feel that she actually cared about my hair and my hesitations with getting it cut. I expressed what I wanted and she repeated it back to me so that I knew we were on the same page. When we were almost finished she had another appointment come up and didn\'t rush with me, as most other salons have done before. She told me that this was my time and not to apologize, which made me feel important and not just another haircut. I would definitely recommend this place. Although a little more than I have paid for with past haircuts, it was well worth it because you\'re not only paying for a haircut, shampoo, and styling, you\'re paying for someone\'s attention to detail, care and concern, conversation, and wonderful experience. All well worth it and not something I\'ve ever got before.|1|1389297352

But instead of rushing through to catch up, she gave each client 100% of her attention. I will continue giving my business to professionals who work that way. I wasn\'t super excited to wait an hour for my appointment, but sometimes things come up, and its completely understandable. Margaret was awesome. After a really good mani/pedi, and now a really good haircut, I\'m pretty sure I\'ve found an excellent salon to keep here in Houston.|1|1389298737

4||makemechoose@gmail.com|Alex V|The services are great. They are a bit on the expensive side, but I always get high quality results. I went for a mani-pedi, and waxing services, and these are the two let downs. They have a very limited selection of colors. In fact the two color options I had in mind to begin with weren\'t available, so I had to settle for another color I only half liked. The end result was pretty, but it wasn\'t my first or second choice. Tam the new nail technician only works on Wednesday, so thats another downside. I also went in for waxing services and the wax had not been pre-heated. So she tweezed instead. That was a let down, because that is something I can do my self, now I have to pay someone else to do a job which I had to go back through and finish up anyways. I love this place and I have never had problems like this before. It might have been a one time thing, but I ended up paying $120 for stuff that wasn\'t what I had originally wanted to begin with. If the people weren\'t so great, that experience would have taught me never to go back again. I recommend the hair services, but these other two areas are still lacking, and so I wouldn\'t recommend them.|1|1389301296

While I was overseas, I was in desperate need of a haircut, but really wanted Umar to take care of me. Thus, I showed up at the Salon lookin a bushman! Umar craftily used his expertise to give me a new hairstyle that I love! I\'m so glad I waited to get my mop cut at Thairapy!|1|1389309697

2|||Anonymous |5 stars for jana. 1 star for check out experience. I have been going to Thairapy from before they relocated. I have never had any issues and have always recommended to friends and family. This last experience almost kept me from going back, but I would like to return to have Jana do my hair again. This review is really not based on my experience with Jana. She was great! But when I went to checkout, you know, that moment when you feel that you look great and kind of feel awesome, I was quickly deflated with my checkout experience. I had an appointment with Rondeann the day before which I had scheduled a month in advance. She had called out that day (this isn\'t the first time I have had to move an appointment because of a call out), and the girl on the phone said I could try Jana and that her prices were lower. I said that I remember getting an email about the new stylist and her special and said I would like to schedule with her. Everything seemed a o.k. When I went to check out the prices were crossed out on the sheet and higher prices had been hand written above. I asked about it and asked about the \"special\" and the checkout girl (I won\'t mention her name here) said that I had an option of hair stylists I could of used, but I was being charged Rondeann\'s prices. I said that I had an appointment the day before, but she had called out and I rescheduled with another person because Rondeann was booked, and that Jana\'s prices were less. She said, :yeah, that was me you spoke with, but this is per the manager\". I highly doubt that the manager would do something like this and desperately wanted to ask her, but I felt very uncomfortable in my position. The girl continued to say it was per the manager and after she walked away again the compassionate young man at the checkout said that he agreed with me and would talk with the manager. He let me check out and was really kind and apologetic. I will be returning to see Jana and hope that my next visit is more smooth... I will keep you posted.|1|1389309979

He sits and listens to what you want and asks for input throughout the process. I go in with the most random ideas and he brings them to fruition. He is very knowledgeable and has been in the business for years. Sandy, one of the nail technicians does amazing jobs.

I am thrilled that Sandy is now doing mani and pedi since I saw the other manicurist put a fresh towel on her table and then placed her purse on top of the towel after it had been on the floor. Then client arrived and she didn\'t bother to change the towel. Disappointed and won\'t use the other manicurist. Wish she would pay more attention to sanitation.|1|1389314993

4|||Anonymous |I got highlights and cut with Kristie through the Bloomspot $99 deal. I originally booked an appointment through their website\'s \"online appointment booking\" and was given an appointment date and time which I confirmed through e-mails, however I received a voicemail from Thairapy the day before the appointment to call them back, and when I did I discovered that my appointment had been given away. How annoying! I reluctantly re-booked and am glad that I did. I had a specific idea of what I wanted, and Kristie listened carefully and delivered it perfectly. I got very fine blonde highlights (size and color I asked for) and again, hair cut just like I wanted, including best bangs cut I\'ve ever had!! So overall, I\'d definitely recommend Kristie for cuts and colour, but don\'t bother trying to use their online booking system because it sucks.|1|1389315150
