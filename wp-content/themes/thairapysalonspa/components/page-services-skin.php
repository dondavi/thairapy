        <div class="service-text"><strong>Microdermabrasion Treatments</strong><br>
          A non-chemical, non-invasive procedure that can help reduce or eliminate wrinkles and fine lines, crow's feet, age spots, light acne scars, and undesired pigmentation that may appear on the skin over time. Using a spray of microcrystals to remove the outermost layer of dry, dead skin cells and reveal younger, healthier-looking skin, microdermabrasion also encourages the production of a new layer of skin cells with higher levels of collagen and elastin.
